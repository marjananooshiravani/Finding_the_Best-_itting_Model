# Finding_the_Best-_itting_Model
This repository contains MATLAB code and materials from my coursework on **Computational Cognitive Modeling**, with a primary focus on **finding the best-fitting model** for given data. The project explores different optimization techniques to estimate regression parameters, compare model performance, and interpret results.
